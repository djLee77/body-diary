      The program is focused on the three main lifts; squat, bench press,
      deadlift. The weights you use each lifting day is based off of your
      current 1 rep max for the squat, bench press, and deadlift. You will be
      lifting using several different set and rep ranges throughout the 6 week
      program. As you move through the weeks, your training will become more
      strength oriented. The percentage of weight you train with will continue
      to increase from week to week, and your volume will drop. During week 5
      the intensity is high; working at 97.5% of your max, and volume is low;
      1-4 repetitions. Since this is a 6 week training program, Jonnie provides
      lifters with three options to choose from for week 6. Skip Week 6. Just
      use projected one rep max from last weekâ€™s 1-4 rep set. Start next cycle.
      Use projected max for next cycle, but take a deload week repeat week 1
      but skip last upper workout. Take this 6th week to actually find your 1
      rep max. Then either deload or start new cycle the next week. You will
      choose three of your preferred upper body accessory movements. One back
      accessory, one shoulders accessory, and one biceps accessory. These
      accessory movements are required, and will be performed on each upper body
      day.
