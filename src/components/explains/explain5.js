      A 5×5 workout comprises compound barbell movements — like squats and
      deadlifts — using heavy weights and lower repetitions per set. As the name
      implies, a 5×5 workout usually involves 5 sets of 5 repetitions. The goal
      is to build strength in compound movements by adding weight every time you
      do the workout.
