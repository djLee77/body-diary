      The PHUL workout routine has four workouts per week: two upper and two
      lower body workouts. The PHUL program is basically a classic 4-day
      upper/lower split where you work each major muscle group twice per week,
      but with the twist that half of the workouts will emphasize strength
      gains, and the other will emphasize muscle gain. This back-and-forth
      between strength and muscle growth is actually not a bad idea at all. It
      introduces an element of periodization into your program, allowing you to
      develop two different qualities in tandem. The strength you gain will
      allow you to use heavier weights in your hypertrophy workouts, The muscle
      you gain will add to your strength capacity between muscle mass and strength.
      Before we get into the nuts and bolts of the program, letâ€™s quickly look over
      some of the fundamentals.
