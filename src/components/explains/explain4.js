      Hypertrophy-Specific Training, or simply HST, is a method of training
      designed to quickly and effectively induce whole body muscle growth. It is
      based on physiological principles of muscular hypertrophy. These
      principles were first discovered in the laboratory, and then organized
      into a method of training that would produce predictable and repeatable
      hypertrophic effects. Hypertrophy-Specific Training arose out of the
      research looking at both the stimuli and mechanisms for muscle cell
      hypertrophy. Of course, translating these principles into applicable
      methods (sets and reps and schedules) brings in some possibility of error.
      As the science continues to explore the exact mechanisms of muscle
      hypertrophy, this error will be whittled away.
